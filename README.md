## Introduction

This repository is a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and more. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science and programming.

## Data Structures

Here is a list of some of the data structures implemented in this repository:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- and more...

Each data structure is organized into its own directory and includes detailed documentation on how to use it.

## Algorithms

We have also implemented various algorithms that operate on these data structures, including:

- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- and more...

Each algorithm is implemented in the relevant programming language and comes with explanations and usage examples.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
